# Pepper_Robot_ChatGBT_Implementation
- I tried to implement ChatGBT so I can have a conversation with our university's Pepper robot
- For now you can input question only from keyboard
- The robot connects to a server that recieves a question and generates an answer
- The server is made in python 3 while the code from the robot is in python 2.7
- IDE used: Coregraphe
